      <strong>13.</strong> Government agencies are strongly
      encouraged to apply the following Policy Principles in
      relation to publicly releasing and licensing their software
      on open source terms. The Principles should be read in their

      Paragraph 14 makes it clear that, for the Open Access and

      required copyright-related rights to license the
      software.</a>

      In the course of its activities, an agency may incorporate or
      adapt pre-existing software source code that is licensed
      under one or more FOSS licences. Alternatively, an agency may
      produce new software source code that interacts with a
      pre-existing FOSS-licensed application. Take a plug-in or
      extension to an existing application as an example. Depending
      on the context, a plug-in or extension may be an adaptation
      of pre-existing source code (e.g., where it has forked an old
      plug-in or extension) or it may be new source code designed
      to interact with a pre-existing application but without
      taking any pre-existing source code. If an agency proposes to
      release its source code in these kinds of situations, the
      agency should:</a>
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <a style="text-align right;" href="#top">respect the terms

        <a style="text-align right;" href="#top">where possible,
        use the same free and open source licence or licences
        applying to the pre-existing software source code, even in

        so</a>

    <p>
      <a style="text-align right;" href="#top"><strong>20.</strong>
      It is important to note that using more permissively-licensed
      source code (e.g., MIT-licensed source code) and
      sharealike/copyleft-licensed source code (e.g., GPL-licensed
      source code) together in a broader project may require you to
      release your new source code under the same
      sharealike/copyleft licence or a compatible licence (in most
      cases the licence will be version 2 or 3 of the
      GPL)</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name=
      "fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> rather than under the more
      permissive licence. Whether this is the case depends on the
      circumstances. Legal advice should be sought if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>21.</strong> Difficult legal questions can arise as
      to whether a given piece of developed software, that in some
      way leverages or interacts with other software, is in fact an
      adaptation or derivative of that software. If:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>an agency's developed software does leverage or interact
      with other software; and
      </li>
      <li>that other software, or part of it, is software owned by
      a third party that has been released under a sharealike open
      source software licence like the GPL,
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      the agency should be cautious about concluding that its
      developed software is <em>not</em> an adaptation or
      derivative of the other software. The need for caution arises
      because if the agency concludes mistakenly that the developed
      software is not an adaptation, release of the developed
      software under an incorrect licence could result in the
      agency breaching third party rights and expose it to the risk
      of complaint or legal action. End users would also be at risk
      of breaching third party rights and be exposed to the risk of
      complaint or legal action. If an agency is in any doubt on
      this issue, it should seek specialist advice (which could be
      both technical and legal) before releasing the software for
      re-use.

      <em>Contribution guidance and files</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>28.</strong> Part of the value of releasing free and
      open source software in accordance with the Open Access and
      Licensing Principle is that external contributors can re-use
      and contribute back improvements to agency-released software
      source code. To accept contributions from external
      contributors in a manner that enables contributions to be
      licensed properly and shared with others, agencies should
      consider providing explicit contribution guidance to users
      that:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>explains any technical aspects of making the
      contributions;
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>sets out any code of conduct, moderation policy or terms
      of use that apply when external contributors engage publicly
      in discussions about the agency-released software source
      code;
      </li>
      <li>indicates whether external contributors need to
      physically sign and return a contributor licence
      agreement<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"
        name="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or other document before the
        agency will accept contributions from them, or specifies
        that the act of contributing source code means the
        contributing user is agreeing to license his or her
        contributions to the agency and others under a specified
        FOSS licence; and
      </li>
      <li>ensures that users know that they must own the copyright
      in their contributions or be permitted to license them to the
      agency and others under the licence that the agency specifies
      (this is important as it seeks to mitigate the risk of the
      agency accepting and publishing external contributions that,
      for copyright reasons, should not be accepted and published).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>29.</strong> In the open source software context, a
      common means of providing this contribution guidance to users
      is by including a 'contributing' file in documentation that
      accompanies the source code. It is important that this file
      (or other document if an alternative approach is used) is
      brought to the attention of users before or at the time they
      submit contributions. Some source code repositories bring the
      existence of a 'contributing' file to the attention of users
      at the time of submission but if an agency is not using such
      a repository it should take care to ensure the terms of
      contribution are brought to users' attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>30.</strong> Whilst this is a decision for agencies,
      NZGOAL-SE suggests that it will usually be unnecessary,
      administratively burdensome and potentially counterproductive
      to require contributing users to physically sign and return a
      formal contributor licence agreement or other document. In
      most cases agencies will be able to secure the rights they
      need, with sufficient confidence, by including the
      'contributing' file mentioned above in documentation
      accompanying the source code and ensuring that this file is
      brought to users' attention before or at the time of
      submitting their contributions. Agencies should seek advice
      from their legal teams if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Comment on assignment versus licensing</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>31.</strong> Agencies may wish to note that there are
      two ways in which an agency could obtain the rights it needs
      from contributors. An agency could require contributing users
      to assign (i.e., transfer) any copyright in their
      contributions to the agency or it could require contributors
      to license their contributions to the agency and others under
      a specified FOSS licence. The advantage of seeking
      assignments of copyright is that this enables the party
      maintaining the source code to own it all. That makes it
      easier to take action against a user who does not comply with
      the applicable FOSS licence terms. The significant
      disadvantage of seeking assignments of copyright is that it
      can inhibit contributions (as developers may wish to retain
      their copyright). In a government context, it could also be
      seen as 'over-reaching'. An assignment also needs to be "in
      writing signed by or on behalf of the assignor" (section 114
      of the Copyright Act 1994). It will be evident from the
      approach suggested above that NZGOAL-SE does <em>not</em>
      recommend that agencies seek to obtain assignments of
      copyright in users' contributions. Rather, the suggested
      approach allows contributors to retain their own copyright
      and only requires them to license their contributions under a
      specified FOSS licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Suggested licensing text for 'contributing' file</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>32.</strong> NZGOAL-SE suggests that agencies include
      the following kind of licensing text in their 'contributing'
      file or other documentation that they bring to the attention
      of users before or at the time of source code submission (the
      content in square brackets needs to be completed):
    </p>
    <pre><code>Copyright and licensing

The source code for this [name of project or software] is licensed under the [insert name of applicable free and open source software licence]. By contributing source code to this [name of project or software], you are agreeing to license your contributions under and on the terms of the [insert name of same licence]. Please note that your licence is irrevocable and royalty-free. You or your licensors retain any copyright in your contributions while allowing others to re-use the source code in any way they like as long as they meet the requirements of the licence.</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>33.</strong> Agencies may also wish to ensure that
      the 'contributing' file, or other document that is brought to
      the attention of users, contains the matters referred to in
      paragraph 28(a)-(e) above.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef"

            The MIT licence is considered preferable to the BSD
            3-Clause licence (another commonly-used permissive open
            source software licence) because the MIT licence
            includes a clearer grant of rights and expressly
            includes the right to sub-license (the BSD licence does
            not). Whilst many interpret a right to sub-license as
            being implicit in the BSD licence, the absence of an
            express reference to it in the BSD licence could
            produce uncertainty for users, most notably users who
            wish to incorporate government-produced code in a work
            licensed under the GPL. The Free Software Foundation
            considers the BSD licence to be compatible with the GPL
            but that must depend on a particular interpretation of
            the BSD licence wording (see generally A Sinclair
            "License Profile: BSD" IFOSS Law Review, 2(1) pp. 1-6).
            The MIT licence doesn't contain the BSD's 'no
            endorsement' clause but, in most cases, the law would
            prevent claims of endorsement without permission
            anyway. Another common permissive licence, the Apache
            License 2.0, was not chosen because it is more complex.
            The Free Software Foundation considers it preferable to
            the BSD and MIT licences as it deals with patent
            licensing and prevents 'patent treachery'. However, in
            New Zealand the Patents Act 2013 excludes computer
            programs "as such" from patentable subject matter (and,
            in any event, historically government agencies have not
            generally been in the business of applying for software
            patents). NZGOAL-SE could have recommended its own
            bespoke permissive licence instead of the MIT licence
            but that would have contributed to further licence
            proliferation and exposed developers to a licence
            they're not familiar with.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a>

            Whilst versions 2 and 3 of the GPL differ in certain
            respects, in essence the GPL allows people to copy and
            distribute the software, to charge a fee for
            transferring it or providing warranty protection, and
            to modify the software and distribute resulting
            derivative works. And, if a person distributes a
            derivative work, that person needs to license it under

            A diverging code fork occurs when agencies make changes
            to the code of open source software without publishing
            the code back to the software's development community.
            The fork is the split between the agency's version of
            the software and the version published by the
            community. Any further changes made by either the
            agency or the community will increase the differences
            of the source code. This can make it difficult for the
            agency to upgrade to a new published version, as the
            agency would have to reapply all its changes. This risk
            may be mitigated by contributing modified source code
            back to the open source software community if
            appropriate.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a>

            A Contributor Licence Agreement, or CLA, is an
            agreement that sets out the terms under which a person
            or entity makes contributions to the project or
            software. A CLA will deal with licensing terms and can
            also agree with topics such as warranties and
            indemnities.<a href="#fnref8">↩</a>

            The 'contributing' file could also seek to obtain a
            warranty (promise) from contributors that they have all
            the rights they require to submit their contributions
            on the terms of the specified licence and an indemnity
            in favour of the agency should it turn out that the
            contributor does not have the required rights. The
            indemnity clause would seek to enable the agency to
            recover, from a contributor, loss the agency incurs as
            a result of the contributor's breach of the warranty.
            NZGOAL-SE suggests, however, that including an
            indemnity could be unnecessary and/or
            counter-productive. Not only could it inhibit
            contributions but it could pose difficulties for
            contributing government departments given restrictions
            on the granting of indemnities under the Public Finance
            Act 1989.<a href="#fnref9">↩</a>
