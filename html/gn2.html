      These guidance notes cover technical practices for developers
      working on government maintained open source software
      projects or when working with external open source projects
      with other developers as part of a wider open source
      community. It follows on from the public consultation for the
      NZGOAL Software Extension open source licensing policy for
      the New Zealand Government. Guidance on the technical aspects
      of releasing open source licensed software was raised as a
      need.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that alongside the technical
      considerations in this guidance note, you should also
      familiarise yourself with the communication and community
      management aspects of open source. Part of developing an open
      licensed project requires the ability to engage in dialogue
      about your work, code out in the open, give and receive
      feedback and interact with contributors in public while using
      modern software development practices to produce and maintain
      the project’s code base over time.
    </p>

      information to these guidance notes you can do so via the

      Don’t repeat yourself
    </h3>
    <p>
      A key concept of using or maintaining an open source project
      is the "Don’t repeat yourself" (DRY) rule. Here are a few
      guidelines to help you through the process of finding
      software that already exists that you can make use off before
      developing from scratch.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          When building a new feature for an existing project check
          to see if someone has already done the same and reuse it.
          A quick search using the name of the software and a short
          description of the feature you are looking to develop
          will usually help you discover existing code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You might also search in other public software
          directories such as:
        </p>

          You may find that parts of your feature exist already in
          existing libraries. If you find part of what you intended
          to build ask yourself if you could reuse it in part and
          extend it to develop the feature you need.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before selecting existing code to reuse, examine how well
          maintained it already is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does the maintainer answer comments on the code?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Has there been a commit to the code recently?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is there a tagged stable version?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is there any documentation?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Are issues or support requests going unanswered?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It’s a good practice to base your new developments on
              maintained existing code, however if the code is not
              well maintained and you find it still solves your
              problem you may want to consider maintaining it
              yourself as a derivative version.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the case of an abandoned repository of code, try to
          contact the maintainer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may be able to adopt the original repository and
              become its new maintainer (or co-maintainer with
              others). This is preferable over "forking" the code
              (taking a copy of it and developing it in parallel).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ideal is for improvements to end up in the
              original repository however sometimes you have no
              choice (for example if the code has been abandoned or
              not actively maintained).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="where-and-how-to-publicly-release-your-code">
      Where and how to publicly release your code?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Part of the open source process involves putting your code
      online in an openly accessible way (not just a zip file on
      your agency website). You will want to ensure there is a
      process for others (and your own team) to contribute
      improvements to this code, raise issues and control the
      collaborative development process. Agencies should look to
      make use of existing code management tools wherever possible
      (NZGOAL-SE advocates for this) to enable others to find and
      reuse the code to avoid the operational costs of running such
      an ICT system. There are online repositories (both free and
      paid) as well as self-hosted options available (should you
      wish to operate your own code repository).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the available options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>(as a service or
          self-hosted)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/explore/projects">Common Web
          Platform</a> (for New Zealand Government users of this
          shared service)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://git.nzoss.org.nz/">NZOSS</a> (free
          community run GitLab repositories from the New Zealand
          Open Source Society)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://www.drupal.org/node/648898">Drupal.org</a> (for
          Drupal themes and modules)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whichever option you choose, you’ll want to ensure that it is
      easy for external parties to interact with. If a contributor
      has an important fix to your software and cannot submit it or
      find the contact details for you as the maintainer, then that
      work may never see the light of day and the benefit of
      community contributions to open source is lost.
    </p>
    <h4 id="setting-up-an-organisation-account">
      Setting up an organisation account
    </h4>
    <p>
      When setting up a code repository account to make your public
      open source releases, agencies should avoid signing up for an
      individual user account. It is recommended to set up an
      organisational account (in some code repositories these are
      called "groups"). You can then assign access to individual
      developer accounts within that organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organisation accounts have the advantage of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Being able to organise a number of open source projects
          in one central location.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Managing the permissions of many individual developer
          accounts (internal teams, contractors or external
          community members) to an organisation's open source
          projects.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure open source projects are not tied to one
          individual and are available into the future (even as
          staff come and go from the projects).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, the <a href="https://github.com/GOVTNZ">govt.nz
      website team have a GitHub organisation</a> grouping all the
      open source licensed code they have released in one place,
      and they assign individual developer access to these projects
      when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When working with external contractors or across agencies,
      giving them read or write access to your repository is
      encouraged. It facilitates the flow of ideas and builds
      stronger community support around your open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communicate the addition and removal of developer access to
      your staff/contractor induction and exit processes. Ideally,
      have someone like a team lead or IT manager that is savvy
      with code repository account management hold the
      administrator access to the organisation account, so that
      they can add or remove staff when required (it's also good
      practice to document the process and make available to your
      HR team). Don’t give admin rights to the organisation account
      to anyone but your agency staff.
    </p>
    <h4 id="individual-user-accounts">
      Individual user accounts
    </h4>
    <p>
      Government and contractor developers should use individual
      accounts when committing their code changes and responding to
      contributors. They should assign their ".govt.nz" email
      address to the account. This helps to keep an audit trail of
      the work history and shows others which code has come from
      the official government maintainer of the project. It’s
      important to maintain transparency when developing code in
      the open. This helps everyone contributing to the project
      know who to contact when working with an open source project.
      If an individual already has an account with the code
      management tool in use for the project, rather than making a
      new account they can often associate their “.govt.nz” email
      address to the account as a secondary email.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are signing up for a new account:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Complete your profile including your image, bio etc so
          others can get to know you better when working on open

      <li>
        <p>
          Ask your team to add you to the organisation account that

      Safe configuration practices
    </h3>
    <p>
      When releasing your code as open source software, ensure that
      you have not included any sensitive credentials in the
      publicly released code itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Database logins
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          API keys
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Configuration settings specific to your production
          deployment
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          User account details
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An issue here is that if you are using version control, once
      something sensitive has been committed to the repository, it
      stays in the history forever. You can remove the project
      history and start with a fresh commit of code, however you
      will lose the project history by doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good practice to adhere to is to build a configuration
      layer into the software that you write. In your software code
      you can then write in references to the variables contained
      within the configuration file (which is not stored in your
      codebase). This avoids publicly exposing the values
      themselves and makes the software code much safer to share
      under an open source licence. You might also provide an
      example configuration file that users can duplicate before
      they configure their own copy of the software.
    </p>
    <h3 id="release-early-and-often">
      Release early and often
    </h3>
    <p>
      Part of the value of developing code in the open is to
      'release early, and often'<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref1" name="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. When working on
      code in public, it is acceptable to have code that is not yet
      ready for production (work in progress, often <a href=
      "#semantic-versioning">indicated by the version number</a>.
      This is how bugs can be caught and fixed early, improving the
      quality of the code before it is put into production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Government open source projects have the potential to be
      harmed by waiting for a particular event to occur before they
      are made publicly available. The longer the project is run
      internally without open sourcing it, the more difficult it
      will be to open.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each step in a project, developers face a choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          do something in a manner compatible with a hypothetical
          future open sourcing; or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          do it in a manner incompatible with open sourcing (eg
          hard-coding an API key).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every time the latter is chosen, the project gets just a
      little bit harder to open source. Sometimes you can't help
      choosing the latter. It's very difficult to give a future
      event the same present-day weight as, say, fixing the
      incoming bugs reported or finishing a new feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in an open source project is part of the version
      history and exposed when you finally open source it. Cleaning
      this up prior to releasing takes time and resources that
      might have been avoided if the project had been open from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <h3 id="version-control">
      Version Control
    </h3>
    <p>
      Version control is like track-changes for documents but much
      more useful. It allows multiple people to work on the same
      code simultaneously and avoids having to pass the work back
      and forth in order for individuals to make their changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using version control allows you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Iteratively build up your software over time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Revert to an earlier version whenever you want to.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record your changes and the reasons why you made them, to
          help future developers understand the process.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Work on changes in parallel as a team before merging them

    <h3 id="distributed-version-control-systems">
      Distributed version control systems
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> has become one of the
      most widely used version control systems. Git is a
      distributed version control system (DVCS) as it allows many
      developers to work simultaneously on the same project code by
      allowing multiple, distributed copies of the work and
      incremental improvements to be contributed to an agreed copy
      of the code (usually in a publicly accessible code
      repository).
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a good idea to use a DVCS for government open source
      projects as they are useful in managing both internal work
      and wider external contributors using the same set of
      software development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Everyone involved in the process has a full copy of the
          code and its history.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It’s easier for developers to create ‘branches’ in their
          code to explore new features or approaches without
          encroaching on others work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Developers can continue to work when the network is
          unavailable, making small incremental commits, and
          merging their changes back with everyone else’s at a
          later date.

      As a government open source project maintainer, set a good

      Working in branches
    </h3>
    <p>
      It's a good rule of thumb to keep your "master" branch in a
      production ready state. At any time you should be able to
      safely deploy or install the "master" and have the current
      stable version of your software running. This means that
      practices such as contributing new code directly to the
      master branch should be avoided. Use branches and pull
      requests to achieve code improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      New features can be tested in separate branches without
      interrupting the project's ability to be released into
      production. People need the freedom to try new things without
      feeling like they're interfering with other's work. There are
      times when code needs to be isolated from the main project
      branch, for example getting a bug fixed or stabilising a new
      release without worrying about tracking the moving target of
      daily development activity. Developers need to be able to
      review and comment on experimental work, and treating
      branches publishable objects makes this possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Quick tips for branches</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use branches liberally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encourage others (whether on your team or contributing to
          the project externally) to use them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid long running branches, that is, build your feature
          in small iterations and merge back frequently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Watch out for branches becoming a mechanism for dividing
          the development community's efforts (the eventual goal of
          branches should be to merge changes back into the master
          and disappear as soon as possible, not to hang around for
          a long time).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use a branching approach that doesn't add undue overhead
          to getting work completed. For example a large project
          might make use of a branching standard called
          "GitFlow"<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"
          name="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, while this might add too
          much undue process if the project is small (in which case
          you might simply use feature branches<a href="#fn5"
          class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name=
          "fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and pull requests to merge to

      Peer reviewing is an important process for teams building

      Making a request for peer review in public
    </h4>
    <p>
      The following is a high level technical walk-through the
      process of raising a pull request on an open source project
      in a public repository for peer review.
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the project repository you want to contribute to.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Raise an "issue" outlining the feature you intend to work
          on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use this issue as the place to discuss and work out
          details of the new proposed feature. This avoids the
          disappointment of your patch being rejected by the
          maintainers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          ‘Fork' a copy of the code repository into your own
          editable public repository.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Checkout your copy of the code to your local development
          environment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make a new branch to work in for your feature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once work is completed locally, push the branch of code
          to your publicly accessible 'fork'.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Raise a 'pull request', a proposal of code changes, on
          the original project repository.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There may be further online discussion while the code is
          peer reviewed as part of the pull request.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once agreed, the maintainer will accept the pull request
          to merge branch your into the project and the new feature
          will now be available, ready for a release.

      Coordinated disclosure of security issues
    </h3>
    <p>
      A coordinated disclosure is designed to improve security of
      software systems and protect the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does this by ensuring:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>That reporters of these issues are treated respectfully
      when they inform agencies of issues.
      </li>
      <li>That both parties (your agency and the reporter) work
      together in a responsible manner, in good faith and within
      the law to correct the issue.
      </li>
      <li>That other user are informed appropriately about the
      issue so they can update their own systems.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It’s important to ensure that external contributors know how
      to correctly contact you if they discover a security
      vulnerability in your open source software. Your organisation
      should respond in good faith to the reporter and encourage
      these type of reports being made safely for all involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have a process in place for this in the form of a
      Coordinated Disclosure policy which informs contributors how
      they should let you know about security related issues
      (rather than publicly disclosing them) and how you will work
      with them to resolve the issue that they have disclosed to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some suggestions when you publish your open source software:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Read over the <a href=
          "http://www.nzitf.net.nz/pdf/NZITF_Disclosure_Guidelines_2014.pdf">
          New Zealand Internet Task Force Coordinated Disclosure
          guidance</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Put in place a coordinated security policy at your
          agency.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"
          name="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Publish your policy on your agency’s website and link to
          it in your software code repository documentation to
          ensure contributors can contact you about security
          related issues.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Include a summary of what contributors should do when
          they find a security issue in your code in your
          CONTRIBUTING.md documentation alongside your code. A
          sample insert for this is provided below.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure your policy makes it clear that security reports
          are sought after and that reporters acting in good faith
          will not be prosecuted. Often the first reaction from
          organisations (both public and private) is to look to
          prosecute or litigate the issue to ensure the reporter
          does not disclose details of the issue. This can often
          mean that security researchers will find vulnerabilities
          but not report them for fear of prosecution. Having a
          policy that makes it clear this won't happen to them is
          key to soliciting reports from outside researchers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set up an email such as "security@AGENCY.govt.nz" that
          can be used to report issues (you may also look into
          ensuring this can be done securely by providing a public
          encryption key<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id=
          "fnref7" name="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Respond promptly and in good faith to reporters of
          security issues (within 2 days is suggested), and inform
          them what the next steps of the process are to get the
          issue resolved. Remember they have gone to the effort of
          letting you know about something important to your
          security and privacy, so work with them to get the issue
          resolved and both parties should take a "do no harm"
          approach.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once you agree with the reporter that there is an issue
          to be fixed, keep the reporter informed as your work on
          the fix progresses (a simple update email once a week to
          the reporter would be appropriate) to show you’re acting
          and haven’t gone silent on the matter. Try and stick to
          any timeframes you set to build trust with the reporter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check your system for any signs of it being compromised
          and then fix the issue.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NZGOAL-SE suggests informing other agencies known to be
          using your software, the GCIO, the GCPO and the Office of
          the Privacy Commissioner (if applicable) so the widest
          number of users get the opportunity to apply the fix to
          the software before it becomes publicly disclosed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lastly, release your fix directly to your publicly
          accessible code repository (and consider applying a
          security patch version number as discussed in the
          <a href="#semantic-versioning">section on Semantic
          Versioning</a> along with an advisory note or CHANGELOG
          entry in your project documentation informing users of
          the known issue and prompting them to update.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Publicly acknowledge the reporter for helping with the
          fix (if they agree).

      Semantic Versioning
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to indicate the status of publicly released code to
      other developers, your project can adopt <a href=
      "https://semver.org"><strong>Semantic Versioning
      (SemVer)</strong></a>, that is, version numbers that have a
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      SemVer is a three point versioning open standard in the
      format of "X.Y.Z". For example, <a href=
      "http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref9" name="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> is version
      <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#v252-2016-03-31">
      <strong>2.5.2</strong></a> using the SemVer standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's detail what these numbers mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>"Z"</strong> refers to a “security” version which
      indicates a bug or security fix has been added to the code
      and you should look to upgrade as soon as possible. Security
      releases should be backwards compatible with the current
      minor version, that is, they should be able to be installed
      without interrupting any additional customisations you may
      have made to a minor version of the software. The security
      release version changes the most frequently of the 3 levels.
      In our CKAN example, there have been 2 security patches
      applied to the current released version as you can see from
      the number on the right of the version (X.Y.2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The** "Y"** indicates a “minor” version and indicates that
      new features have been added and they will be backwards
      compatible with previous minor versions. For the CKAN example
      here, you can read the middle number and quickly find out
      that this is the 5th minor version of the software (X.5.Z)
      and this version should be compatible with version 2.4.0 all
      the way back to 2.0.0 or any future versions such as 2.6.0
      for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>"X"</strong> indicates a "major" version and
      changes if the code undergoes a major rewrite with backwards
      <em>incompatible</em> changes. Major versions indicate to
      developers that they will need to do some work when upgrading
      the version of the software if they have made any
      customisations. From the CKAN version number on the left
      (2.Y.Z), you can find out that there have been 2 major
      versions of the software released.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the CKAN example together, we can quickly get an
      understanding as a developer that there have been have 2
      major versions, 5 minor versions of the current major version
      and 2 security patches to the latest minor version - hence
      version <strong>2.5.2.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When first releasing an open source project publicly it is
      common to use version 0.1.0 and begin to increment from this
      point forward. This indicates that there is no major stable
      version yet ready for production. Over time as incremental
      contributions are made and the code is improved, tested and
      deemed ready to use in projects the semantic version would
      increment to 1.0.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      SemVer is a widely practiced standard in the wider open
      source software community and recommended for government open
      source projects to help communicate to external contributors
      valuable information about the project status.
    </p>
    <h3 id="testing-in-open-source-projects">
      Testing in open source projects
    </h3>
    <p>
      Testing in any software project is useful as it helps ensure
      that software does what it is supposed to do. In the context
      of an open source project this is even more important, as
      contributors to the project may be external and have less
      context about the inner workings of the software than the
      original maintainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we won’t talk specifically about how to write tests for
      specific applications (the scope depends on your project and
      is too wide to cover here), manually testing can be very time
      consuming so it is a good practice to set up an automated
      suite of tests. This helps determine if any potential changes
      to the code will cause it stop functioning as it is supposed
      to <em>before</em> changes make it into the released version
      of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called 'regression testing' and becomes valuable as
      the size and complexity of your project grows. There is a
      trade off of the time to write the tests versus code for the
      application itself. Here you need to use judgement and test
      appropriately for the size and importance of the features in
      your open source project.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is common practice in open source projects to require that
      contributors ensure their changes pass any existing tests,
      before they are accepted. It’s also preferred that they
      contribute tests for new code they write and submit. Again,
      in this case be careful that requiring tests with every
      contribution doesn’t bottleneck the process of contribution
      itself (you want to encourage people's efforts not hinder
      them). You might want to explicitly describe what type of
      code changes do or do not require testing in your project
      documentation, so contributors know when they need to write
      these.
    </p>
    <h4 id="automating-your-testing">
      Automating your testing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Many existing public code repositories include or can
      integrate with automated regression testing tools (referred
      to as Continuous Integration or CI). These can often be set
      up free of charge for open source projects and help external
      contributors see when a change they propose stops the
      software working as intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using branches and pull requests as part of your
      development workflow, most CI tools run your tests whenever a
      new change is proposed via a branch or pull request. CI tools
      can also block the change from being merged into the code if
      the tests are failing, which avoids bugs making their way
      into the software to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are some of the available tools often used for
      automated testing in open source projects.

    <p>
      Travis CI integrates with GitHub repositories to run your
      tests automatically, whenever new code is pushed to a branch.
      To set up your project to work with GitLab CI you include a
      ".travis.yml" file in your project and then follow their
      setup guide at: <a href=
      "https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/" class=

    </p>
    <p>
      GitLab CI is integrated into the GitLab code repository tool
      (from version 8.0 and up). It’s a good choice if you are
      using GitLab to host your open source project. To set up your
      project to work with GitLab CI you include a ".gitlab-ci.yml"
      file in your project and then follow their setup guide at:
      <a href=
      "https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/quick_start/README.html"

      Jenkins is a self hosted, open source CI tool. It’s useful
      when you are testing code internally or if you are hosting
      your own code repository tools for your projects. Assuming
      you have an instance of Jenkins running, to set up your
      project to work you include "JenkinsFile" file in your
      project and then follow their setup guide at: <a href=

      Documenting your code
    </h2>
    <p>
      Documentation is an important part of releasing your work as
      open source. This helps users get started, understand what
      your code does and how they might make use of it. Good
      documentation clearly answers questions that users have -
      either by informing or by instructing them.<a href="#fn10"

          Document your code for your own future reference, chances
          are one day you’ll thank yourself (and your team).
          Because it’s in the open others will benefit too!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Some documentation is better than none. Leave
          documentation "stubs" (pages with headings of known
          undocumented areas). This helps by providing a clear
          place to contribute documentation and shows you are aware
          of what is and isn’t complete. It is common practice in
          open source to accept things as incomplete as long as
          this is pointed out to users.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Understand that documentation is never really finished,

          <strong>Tutorials</strong> - Step-by-step guides that
          instruct your user how to do something specific with your
          code. This might be a detailed walkthrough of getting
          started or how to accomplish a common coding task. They
          should be short, easy to complete (but not so easy that
          learning does't occur) and should demonstrate what it’s

          inform users about the concepts and features you’ve
          included in your software. These might also include some
          code snippets to help explain concepts. Aim for
          completeness; a user should be able to feel like they

          arguments and implementation specifics of your code so
          the audience is likely to be more technical. Reference

      Markdown documentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use a open standard format when writing your documentation so
      that anyone can read it. A standard format widely used for
      documentation is called Markdown.<a href="#fn13" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref13" name="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
      It’s easy to learn , small in file size and captures both the
      content and formatting. Markdown can be used for outputting
      many other formats, for example you can use it to produce
      HTML for websites, PDF and Docx for print, or even Epub for
      e-readers while keeping a single source of truth, the
      Markdown source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown documentation is treated exactly the same as code in
      your version control system - you can track the changes over
      time, many developers are able to work on it at the same time
      and merge changes together once ready to release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown is a text file and saved with the file extension
      ".md". You write your content using plain text and use a set
      of plain text “marks” to represent the format of your
      document.
    </p>
    <h4 id="example-of-markdown-format">
      Example of markdown format
    </h4>
    <p>
      An example of Markdown looks like this when writing it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>    # My documentation

    This is a paragraph of text talking about my work and how you might make use of it as a developer. You’ll note paragraphs need no extra formatting.

     * Here I’ll make a bullet point

     * And another

     * One more

     1. An ordered list of numbers

     2. Another number

    ## Here is a sub heading

    ### And a sub, sub-heading

    [Here is a link](https://ict.govt.nz)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Markdown is rendered into human readable html pages. For
      example the above Markdown would render as follows when
      viewed online as part of your code repository:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <h1 id="my-documentation">
        <strong>My documentation</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph of text talking about my work and how

        paragraphs need no extra formatting.

      We recommend learning and making use of Markdown for
      government open source documentation and if a document copy
      (PDF/Docx) is required then these can be generated from the
      source material using several <a href=
      "https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf">open</a> <a href=

    <h4 id="markdown-metadata">
      Markdown Metadata
    </h4>
    <p>
      Another great aspect of Markdown format is you can also
      include metadata directly within it. You might use this to
      provide additional information to users about the nature of
      the documentation contained in the document. Markdown
      metadata is 3 dashes followed by key/value pairs at the top
      of your document before you start the first paragraph, closed
      with a final 3 dashes. Any metadata standard can be
      represented, but use of a few commons attributes like “Title”
      and “Description” is recommended and you might also implement
      an existing open metadata standard such as <a href=
      "http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml">Dublin
      Core</a>.

      Getting started with project documentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Documenting a new project can be daunting, ideally you can
      split up this task by documenting features as you code them
      though this is not always practical. For the first set of
      documentation we recommend that you limit the scope to a few
      key aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your README (as described above).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create one tutorial that walks new users through a common
          task or use of the software. This helps show the user
          what can be done and gets them thinking about how they
          might use your code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Describe what you know is missing from the documentation
          (you might also create "stub" pages for these).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don’t need to set any expectations as to when these will
      get written, it’s acceptable in open source to simply ensure
      users are aware of any shortcomings and then they can choose
      to use your code anyway and they are free to contribute any
      improved documentation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="structuring-your-documentation-pages">
      Structuring your documentation pages
    </h3>
    <p>
      It’s a good idea to use a consistent structure when you have
      documentation that spans several separate pages and topics. A
      skeleton structure for a section of your documentation might
      look like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Metadata.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heading (descriptive enough to tell the reader what topic
          is covered).
        </p>
      </li>

      Writing style guide
    </h3>
    <p>
      To keep your documentation easy to use and consistent, the
      use of a writing guide is a good idea. Your agency may
      already have its own set of writing guides in which case you
      might use this. Alternatively you could look to reuse the
      <a href="https://www.govt.nz/about/our-style-guide/">Govt.nz
      writing style guide</a> as it is a good example of ensuring
      writing is accessible and in plain English while allowing the
      use of technical terms which are unavoidable in software
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other general points for technical writing styles
      are:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Important information goes first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use an active voice - tell the reader what you want them
          to do or what they are learning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Know and write for your audience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Keep sentences short.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid superlatives, and keep technical writing clear and
          concise. It’s about delivering information to your users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use callouts for really important information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Things to avoid:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Losing the reader by not getting to the point quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Confusing the reader by using lots of jargon or technical
          terms without first defining them (unless you're certain
          of your audience).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Not providing enough context to aid understanding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Not stating what the reader will learn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Not updating your documentation as your code changes over
          time.

      Understanding copyright and licensing
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a developer working with open source projects, it’s
      important to have an understanding of copyright and
      licensing, how they differ and how you use them for open
      source release.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section will give a simple overview of copyright,
      licensing and some considerations when contributing to open
      source projects or accepting contributions into your own
      government open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section is not a substitute for robust legal advice and
      every edge case. For a fuller understanding of open source
      licensing please read over the <a href=

    </p>
    <h3 id="copyright">
      Copyright
    </h3>
    <p>
      Copyright is a set of property rights that automatically come
      into existence when you write software code. Copyright
      applies to the actual product of the work, not the idea to
      produce the work. Open source projects are grounded in
      copyright, there is an owner and this owner can decide what
      happens to the work, for example, licensing it under open
      source terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create work while employed or are commissioned to
      write software (as a contractor) then the owner of the
      copyright is generally the entity that you did the work on
      behalf of, you don’t personally hold the copyright in this
      situation (unless it has been specifically written into your
      contract that you do).
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of code created in or on behalf of the New Zealand
      Government (the "Crown"), unless contracted out of (that is,
      arrangements made in the contract to alter the default):
    </p>
    <p>
      "the Crown is the first owner of any copyright subsisting in
      any work created by a person who is employed or engaged by
      the Crown, under a contract of service, apprenticeship, or a
      contract for services" (Crown Copyright, 2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_copyright#New_Zealand">"Crown
      Copyright"</a> and means the NZ Government as a whole owns
      the copyright in the code (and the agencies look after it on
      the Crown’s behalf).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other agencies could make use of this Crown Copyright code,
      however Crown Copyright doesn’t apply to some organisations
      in Government. Crown Entities and State-Owned Enterprises for
      example are excluded from Crown Copyright when they create
      works (in this case the Crown Entity itself is the copyright
      owner). In this situation, in order for the widest reuse
      across NZ Government in the simplest way, you can license the
      code using open source licences as set out in NZGOAL Software
      Extension.
    </p>
    <h3 id="licensing">
      Licensing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Licensing is related to copyright but is a distinct concept.
      Licensing concerns itself with two things: who "owns" the
      code, and who has the right to use it. The author of software
      code holds the code's copyright (in terms of government this
      is usually Crown Copyright as mentioned above), and are the
      copyright holder. If they would like to let others reuse the
      code, they need to grant them a "license" to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open source licenses grant a set of rights normally reserved
      for the copyright holder (hence the term "all rights
      reserved" you often see in association with copyright) to
      another person. For instance, the right to use, copy, modify,
      or redistribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      This license is provided in writing along with the code (in
      the LICENCE file) and states the terms under which the code
      may be used by the world at large, they won’t have to ask
      permission specifically. Most common licence types are the
      “copyleft” and the “permissive” and there are many licences
      you can use that fit into these two categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      For government open source projects we recommend the use of
      one of two licenses, the GPL or the MIT. See <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/nzgoal-se-review-and-release-process/">
      NZGOAL Review and release process</a> which sets out in more
      detail the legal aspects of selecting and applying an open
      source licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id="accepting-contributions-from-the-community">
      Accepting contributions from the community
    </h3>
    <p>
      Project documentation should clearly state the license under
      which code is distributed and that any code publicly
      contributed to (e.g. pull requests, code comments or patches)
      must be licensed under the same terms. This is not uncommon
      in open source projects and is referred to as "terms of
      contribution" in a CONTRIBUTING file alongside the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such terms, either the individual contributor will
      retain the copyright, and their publicly distributed code is
      licensed under the same terms as the code they are
      contributing to. NZGOAL Software Extension recommends this
      approach and suggests the <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/#contributions">
      following insert you can use in your CONTRIBUTING file</a>:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>The source code for this [name of project or software] is licensed under the [insert name of applicable free and open source software licence]. By contributing source code to this [name of project or software], you are agreeing to license your contributions under and on the terms of the [insert name of same licence]. Please note that your licence is irrevocable and royalty-free. You or your licensors retain any copyright in your contributions while allowing others to re-use the source code in any way they like as long as they meet the requirements of the licence.</code></pre>
    <p>
      Alternatively, the project maintainer may request that
      copyright be assigned to them. At such time they will license
      the code under the same terms as the repository so the
      contributor can still make use of their contributions along
      with all other users. Note, NZGOAL Software Extension
      <strong>doesn’t recommend this second approach</strong> as it
      can been seen as "over-reaching" in its position as copyright
      holder of externally contributed code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way the copyright is managed for contributions, the
      rights and freedoms of the shared code remain the same - all
      can reuse, copy, modify and redistribute because the overall
      open source licence the project is released under allows
      this.

      What do contractors need to know about copyright and
      licensing?
    </h3>
    <p>
      As a contractor doing work for New Zealand Government
      agencies, it's important to be aware that unless you have
      explicitly stated in your services contract that you will be
      the owner of any copyright material you produce while working
      for the New Zealand public sector, then the agency that
      commissions you to do the work owns the copyright of the work
      you produce for them for the duration of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is stated in legislation under the New Zealand Copyright
      Act 1994:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Where—</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
            <em>a person commissions, and pays or agrees to pay for
            ... the making of a computer program … ; and</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
            <em>the work is made in pursuance of that
            commission,—</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>that person is the first owner of any copyright in the
        work.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Subsections (2) and (3) apply subject to any agreement
        to the contrary.</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef"
        id="fnref14" name="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is referred to as the <em>"commissioning rule"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also mirrored in the New Zealand Government Model
      Contracts (GMC) that are commonly used when agencies hire
      contractors. The Intellectual Property section of this says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>12.2 New Intellectual Property Rights in the
        Deliverables become the property of the Buyer when they are
        created.</em><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id=
        "fnref15" name="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As a contractor then you need to ensure you have the agencies
      permission to release the code you work on under an open
      source licence. Remember, you need to own the copyright in
      order to grant freedoms under an open source licence.

      NZGOAL-SE puts forward a default set</a> of well used open
      source software licenses for the release of government open
      source code. These are the GNU General Public Licence (GPL)
      and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) licence.
      When licensing most new software as open source these two
      licences should cover most use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be special cases where circumstances may require
      the use of an alternative open source software licence.
      NZGOAL-SE section 69 allows for this scenario by putting
      forward two alternative licences; the Lesser General Public
      Licence and the Affero General Public Licence; suggesting
      particular use cases as to when you might use these. You can
      also make use of any of the available open source licenses so
      long as you can justify why you would use these in place of
      the recommended default set (GPL or MIT) from NZGOAL-SE.

      work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by
      the licensed work may be distributed under different terms
      and without source code for the larger work.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example use of LGPL is if the source code to be released
      is a library of code and the agency knows that there are
      proprietary software suppliers who wish to use the agency's
      particular library within, or to link the library to, their
      own proprietary source code without having to release (or it
      being argued that they have to release) their proprietary
      code if they distribute their software. The GNU Lesser
      General Public Licence (LGPL) will allow this kind of use
      without exposing the downstream user to risk. The LGPL
      requires software licensed under it to be modifiable by end
      users through source code availability and does not require
      proprietary code that is linked to the LGPL-licensed library
      to be made available under the GPL.

      This strong copyleft license is focused on making available
      complete source code of licensed works and modifications,
      which include larger works using a licensed work, under the

      preserved in the source code. Contributors provide an express

    </p>
    <p>
      The sharealike obligation in the GPL (i.e., the obligation to
      license one's adaptations under the GPL) is triggered upon
      distribution of an adaptation. Where software is installed on
      a server to provide a service to end users (e.g., in an
      application service provider or cloud services context), the
      sharealike obligation is not triggered. To some people this
      seemed like a loophole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GNU Affero General Public Licence (AGPL) was designed to
      close that loophole. It is based on the GPL and states that
      if source code is adapted then the "public use of a modified
      version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
      access to the source code of the modified version".
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be cases in which an agency is open source
      licensing software that is used on servers where the agency
      would like to achieve this result or where communities of
      interest ask the agency to achieve this result. If so, the
      agency may wish to select the GNU Affero General Public
      Licence (AGPL) instead of the GPL.
