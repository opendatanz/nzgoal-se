# Introduction for transparent revision process of NZGOAL-SE

The public consultation period has ended (30 April) but that's not the end of the process for NZGOAL-SE. Firstly, we'd like to say thank you for your comments. We will analyse all feedback submitted during the public comment period and revise the policy as necessary.

We are going to be carrying this out in a transparent manner on the [Open Data NZ GitHub account](https://github.com/opendatanz/nzgoal-se/). Revisions will be subject to a lot of change during this first two weeks so please bear with us. We will raise proposals of change (_pull requests_) and where possible provide links back to the original online public conversations that guided the revisions and give inline supporting comments behind decisions.
 
For the first two weeks of the revision process (2 - 15 May, 2016) we will refrain from reviewing any publicly submitted pull requests on GitHub (though you are welcome to make them). This is to give us time to review the conversations from the [Loomio public consultation](https://www.loomio.org/g/NohQxyr9/nzgoal-software-extension-discussion-of-draft) (carried out 30 March - 30 April) and work out how to best incorporate these into the revision from a practical and legal point of view. 
 
Once all major revisions are complete, for a period of one week starting the 16 May 2016, we will review any final public direct contributions via _pull requests_ (See below on how to make a _pull request_).
 
Alternatively, the revised draft will be posted (once initial revisions are completed) on [ict.govt.nz](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/) and you can email your proposed change to [opendata@linz.govt.nz](mailto:opendata@linz.govt.nz).
