These guidance notes cover technical practices for developers working on government maintained open source software projects or when working with external open source projects with other developers as part of a wider open source community. It follows on from the public consultation for the NZGOAL Software Extension open source licensing policy for the New Zealand Government. Guidance on the technical aspects of releasing open source licensed software was raised as a need.

It’s important to note that alongside the technical considerations in this guidance note, you should also familiarise yourself with the communication and community management aspects of open source. Part of developing an open licensed project requires the ability to engage in dialogue about your work, code out in the open, give and receive feedback and interact with contributors in public while using modern software development practices to produce and maintain the project’s code base over time.
