# Introduction for transperant revision process of NZGOAL-SE

The public consultation period has ended (30 April) but that's not the end of the process for NZGOAL-SE. Firstly, we'd like to say thank you for your comments. We will analyse all feedback submitted during the public comment period and revise the policy as necessary.

We are going to be carrying this out in a transparent manner on the [Open Data NZ GitHub account](https://github.com/opendatanz/nzgoal-se/). Revisions will be subject to a lot of change during this first two weeks so please bear with us. We will raise proposals of change (_pull requests_) and where possible provide links back to the original online public conversations that guided the revisions and give inline supporting comments behind decisions.
 
For the first two weeks of the revision process (2 - 15 May, 2016) we will refrain from reviewing any publicly submitted pull requests on GitHub (though you are welcome to make them). This is to give us time to review the conversations from the [Loomio public consultation](https://www.loomio.org/g/NohQxyr9/nzgoal-software-extension-discussion-of-draft) (carried out 30 March - 30 April) and work out how to best incorporate these into the revision from a practical and legal point of view. 
 
Once all major revisions are complete, for a period of one week starting the 16 May 2016, we will review any final public direct contributions via _pull requests_ (See below on how to make a _pull request_).
 
Alternatively, the revised draft will be posted (once initial revisions are completed) on [ict.govt.nz](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/) and you can email your proposed change to [opendata@linz.govt.nz](mailto:opendata@linz.govt.nz).

## Contributions considered

All contributions are subject to the code of conduct, [please see the information on contributing](https://github.com/opendatanz/nzgoal-se/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Please feel free to raise changes for any: 

 >* Typos and iterative improvements
 >* Sentence structures that could be clearer 
 >* Minor line changes

 We won't be considering any:

 >* New sections (unless they we already raised as part of the initial public consulation)
 >* Major rewrites of sections (as we'll have to run these past a legal eye each time)
 >* Complete overhauls of the document (because we're in the process of iteration not overhaul at this time)

You may provide feedback during the transperant revision process in two ways. We ask that you do not submit the same content more than once. Please be aware that while we will consider your pull request, we may not necessrily merge it into the final revision. We will close all open pull requests at the end of the process and these will still be publically avialalbe via GitHub. 

## Options to contribute

1. Direct changes and line edits to the content are welcome through [_pull requests_](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) by clicking "Edit this page" in the side menu. If prompted, follow the instructions to “Fork this repository and propose changes” (you'll need a GitHub account). You do not need to install any software to suggest a change. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a pull request for your changes to be considered for merging into the document. Directions on how to submit a pull request can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Pull requests that have already been submitted for the proposed revisions can be found [here](https://github.com/opendatanz/nzgoal-se/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
